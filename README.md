# Automatic-Street-Lights-and-U-Turn-Accident-Prevention


Project start with sensing an obstacle. At the starting and ending of the road the street lights are always turn on. 
Whenever an  obstacle is detected to the sensor it will automatically turn on the corresponding and next to that street lights . 
After the obstacle is  pass away then the street lights will automatically turn off . 
So ,that the light energy will be saved atleast to some extent .
Where there is a U-turn either on a ground level road or in mountainous area, the place becomes prone to accidents, particularly if the speed of vehicles is more, or non-signaling of horn and/light while taking the U-turn.
When there is a vehicle at one side of U-turn the opposite led and the buzzer will be on .
So, that the vehicle at another side will know that there is a vehicle in opposite side. So ,it will slow down the vehicle speed.
By using this we can prevent U-turn accidents and save light energy.

COMPONENTS USED:

  Arduino Uno Board, led’s, Buzzer, Lead wires , Jumper wires, LDR, Bread Board, IR sensor’s.
